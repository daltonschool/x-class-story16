There once was a man named Alex

Also, there was a huge horse her name was little Elly

"Let's all try!" she said

Don't ever try that again.

Now we all go to the river

The whole place exploded in laughter
this is alex's line!
Then it was all just beginning!

The End (or not)


Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it.
