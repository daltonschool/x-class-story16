There once was a man named Alex

Also, there was a huge horse her name was little Elly

Alex rode the horse to the last three paragraphs, which were awesome

Don't ever try that again.

Now we all go to the river

The whole place exploded in laughter

Then it was all just beginning!

The End (or not)
